### **Interpolation Search Algorithm** 🔍  
Interpolation Search is an **improved version of Binary Search** that works efficiently when elements in the array are **uniformly distributed**. Instead of always checking the middle element, it **estimates** the position of the target using interpolation formula.

### **How Interpolation Search Works**
1. **Estimate** the probable position of the target using the formula:  
`pos=low+(((target - arr[low])×(high−low))/(arr[high]−arr[low]))`
3. If `arr[pos]` is the target, return `pos`.
4. If `arr[pos]` is **less** than the target, search the **right half**.
5. If `arr[pos]` is **greater** than the target, search the **left half**.
6. Repeat until the element is found or search space is exhausted.

### **Time & Space Complexity**
| Case        | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Best**   | **O(1)** (If element is found in the first attempt) | **O(1)** (Uses only a few variables) |
| **Worst**  | **O(n)** (If values are not uniformly distributed) | **O(1)** |
| **Average**| **O(log log n)** (Better than Binary Search for uniform distribution) | **O(1)** |

#### **Python Implementation**
```python
def interpolation_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while low <= high and arr[low] <= target <= arr[high]:
        # Estimate position using interpolation formula
        pos = low + ((target - arr[low]) * (high - low) // (arr[high] - arr[low]))

        if arr[pos] == target:
            return pos  # Found, return index
        elif arr[pos] < target:
            low = pos + 1  # Search right half
        else:
            high = pos - 1  # Search left half

    return -1  # Not found

# Example Usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
target = 40

result = interpolation_search(arr, target)
print(f"Element {target} found at index: {result}" if result != -1 else "Element not found")
```
**Example Output:**
```
Element 40 found at index: 3
```

### **When to Use Interpolation Search?**
✅ **Works best on uniformly distributed data** – If data is evenly spaced, it can outperform Binary Search.  
✅ **Faster than Binary Search in some cases** – It achieves **O(log log n)** complexity instead of **O(log n)**.  
✅ **Better for large datasets** – Since it estimates the target's position rather than dividing the list in half.

🚫 **Not ideal for non-uniform data** – Performance can degrade to **O(n)** if values are clustered unevenly.
